        <h1>What the cabbage is this guide!?!</h1>
        <p>This guide was written with the intent of refreshing the ATBP community's mind about the actual gameplay part of the game. I will be attempting to provide as accurate information as I can recall in the hopes that one day hopefully in the near future, this guide could help prepare new and old players alike for whenever the game is re-released.</p>
        <p>What this guide is NOT is the be-all and end-all of how to play, do not take everything said in this guide as fact and do not let anything said here hinder your potential creativity when it comes to building champions or in match strategy, what works for me may not work for you and that's fine.</p>
        <p>If you are an absolute beginner or just want a refresher course I would suggest heading over to the <a href="./tutorial.html">Basics of Battle Party</a> page first. For anything not covered in this guide, such as complete backpack listings and skill descriptions, head on over to the <a href="https://adventure-time-battle-party.fandom.com/wiki/Adventure_Time_Battle_Party_Wiki">ATBP Wiki.</a></p>
        
        <p>With that all in mind, I hope you learn something from this guide, or at the very least enjoy your time reading it.</p>
