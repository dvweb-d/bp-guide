            <h2>Basic Gameplay</h2>
            <p>BMO is a very simple character, with an easy to understand kit and gameplan. Blind Auto-attackers with your Q, protect yourself and teammates against divers with W, and with your autos and E in both lane and in teamfights.</p>

            <h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>+ Huge Amounts of CC, letting them be a soft counter to a large amount of the cast</li>
                <li>+ Along with Lich just invalidates most melee picks</li>
                <li>+ Built optimally can be a near oppressive force in lane</li>
                <li>= Mediocre Damage if not built glass cannon</li>
                <li>- BMO's only real negative is their lack of wave clear without wasting an E cooldown</li>

                    <p class="passive">Passive - Slow-MO</p>
                    <p>There isn't much to say about this passive, just try to be at two stacks or more before a teamfight starts since the slow is amazing for setting up favorable matches.</p>
                </div>

                    <p class="q">Q - BMO is Camera</p>
                    <p>BMO's Q does very good damage for how low of a cooldown it is, along with invalidating a large portion of the cast. Remember that you can turn the hitbox for extra range at the tips of the cone.</p>

                    <p class="w">W - Game Frame</p>
                    <p>Most of the time you are just going to be mashing W as quick as possible to get the fastest stun that you can, if you are building AP BMO or a mixed build, consider saving your passive for this since the slow applies on cast, making it easier to get more of the hits in on melee targets.</p>

                    <p class="e">E - Bouncy Bee</p>
                    <p>It does a lot of damage. In a line. I'm sure you can figure out how to use this one.</p>

            <p>Mash your Q and W keys upon the game loading up to get an extra free stack of your passive, letting you start the first fight with your slow up</p>
            <p>BMO really isn't complicated, their skill ceiling is more based on how well you can use their basic kit rather than obscure tricks</p>

            <div id="metarole" class="tabcontent">
            <h2>Meta and Role</h2>
            <p>BMO is a mainstay in the Battle Party meta, and they fit well onto the vast majority of teams. Their high amount of CC makes them a good blind pick in general since you aren't sacrificing much damage if you build them as an auto attacker. BMO is easily one of the top characters with very little tradeoffs, the only thing to keep in mind is to pair them with at least one person who can wave clear efficiently as BMO themselves cant do this particularly well without building full AP or glass cannon.</p>

                <li>Bella Noche's Knapsack - 1/1/3/3/1/3/1/3/5/5 (4/0/4/0/2) : Like so many other characters BMO's spells doing damage doesn't really matter much if you can just auto attack for a very healthy amount of damage and be tanky enough to survive almost any amount of burst, the same build with Techno-Tank also works just fine</li>
                <li>Champion's Backpack - 1/1/2/2/1/2/1/2/x/x (4/4/x/x/x) : Fill in x with whatever tank stat you need, usually armor; BMO's glass cannon build, you will do a lot of damage and still be fairly hard to kill given your CC, but if you are focused down, or hit by a stray charm or Jake Q, etc, you will die so be aware.</li>
                <li>Sorcerous Satchel or Nearly Ultimate Wizard Wear - 2/2/4/4/2/4/2/4/3/3 (0/4/2/4/0) and 2/2/3/3/2/3/2/3/4/4 (0/4/4/2/0) respectively : AP BMO is fun and your E will hit for a lot of damage, but its not as strong as the Bella or Techno variants. The NUWW build can also be switched to 0/2/4/4/0 for a more tanky/cd based variant.</li>
