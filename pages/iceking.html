            <h2>Basic Gameplay</h2>
            <p>Ice King has a fairly simple gameplan involving a rotation heavy style, using his very good wave clear to get pressure on the map for his teammates to take objectives.</p>
            <p>In fights you are a backline mage with only the goals of hitting your Q, doing as much damage as possible with your W and E before inevitably dying due to your lack of survivability</p>

            <div id="prosandcons" class="tabcontent">
            <h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>+ Excellent wave clear, if not the best in the game</li>
                <li>+ Very good aoe damage</li>
                <li>= Unless going glass cannon, very mediocre damage while spells are on cooldown</li>
                <li>= Doesn't contribute much besides lane control and damage</li>
                <li>- Particularly susceptible to dive and poke</li>

                <p class="passive">Passive - Ice Shield </p>
                <p>Ice King's passive would be very useful in any other game but a dual slow just isn't very effective outside of sometimes letting you escape or hit a Q easier</p>

                <p class="q">Q - Deep Freeze</p>
                <p>Ice King's main line of defense against dive and also his only CC, it takes a little bit of practice to hit consistently due to its slower travel speed than other skill shots, be aware that certain characters (Finn, Gunter, Billy) can use their mobility options to avoid your Q completely, so try and hold it until you know those are on cooldown </p>

                <p class="w">W - Hailstorm</p>
                <p>Ice King's main form of damage and wave clear, also very good when paired with any CC (including your own)</p>

                <p class="e">E - Frosty Doom</p>
                <p>This is your secondary form of damage in teamfights, and also your panic button if you get dove on but miss your Q. The giant move speed buff can also allow for any attack based or hybrid builds to kite melee characters efficiently</p>

            <h2 class="advancedtips"><a id="advancedtipslink">Advanced Tips</a></h2>
            <p>Spacing is extremely important with Ice king. Learn the range of your Q and never attempt to get closer than that unless you're sure you can hit Q consistently.</p>
            <p>Your W has a fairly generous cast range so you can use it to steal camps from the opposite side of the wall consistently.</p>
            <p>Outside of knowing your ranges there isn't much more advanced about Ice King, he is fairly simple otherwise.</p>
            </div>    
    
    
    
            <div id="metarole" class="tabcontent">
            <h2>Meta and Role</h2>
            <p>Ice King is an okay choice in the meta, favoring heavily in comps with little wave clear such as a core of Lich and Magic Man, unfortunately most things Ice King can do Princess Bubblegum can also do such as wave clear and harassing in lane, but Ice King has more damage overall so hes still a relevant choice.</p>
            <p>Another detriment for Ice King is just how squishy he is, he has to be very careful while other similar mages don't have to play as safe, meaning he can be fairly dangerous in a blind pick game such as battleparty </p>

                <li>Nearly Ultimate Wizard Wear - 2/2/3/3/2/3/2/3/4/4 (0/4/4/2/0) OR Sorcerous Satchel - 2/2/4/4/2/4/2/4/3/3 ( 0/4/2/4/0) : Ice King's full AP build, you hit like a truck but are fairly worthless while your spells are on cooldown</li>
                <li>Fridjitsu: Ninjas of the Ice - 1/1/5/5/1/5/1/5/2/2 (4/2/0/0/4) : Ice King's attack speed based build, mostly for fun but if you get to level 9 can be a legitimate threat (</li>
