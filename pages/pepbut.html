            <h2>Basic Gameplay</h2>
            <p>Pepbut is an anti-auto attacker diver/bruiser hybrid, with the ability to start teamfights or safely leave them fairly easily. You can play him as a pure jungler, or his more niche role of bullying people as they rotate through the map unsafely using his passive to hide in high traffic areas. Your W is one of the longest mobility skills in the game and can easily clear any terrain including the middle walls, but you probably won't want to do this at the start of the game due to how important your W is to your teamfighting ability. Whatever build you choose for pepbut you may want to stick to building at least one tanky item so that you can properly deal with all the ranged poke you'll be taking. Remember that your E is one of the strongest sieging tools, if you see the opportunity to run down a tower with unattended minions you should take it, you can always escape by running into the opponents base and W'ing through the middle wall if they respond faster than expected.</p>

            <ul>

            <li>+ Very good jungler with some of the fastest potential boss camp clears</li>
            <li>- Mediocre usefulness in teamfights outside of the initial W in</li>
            <li>- Like most melees, extremely susceptible to any form of CC</li>

                <p>Your passive has two main uses: to heal after a fight, or to camp in an area you expect an enemy to rotate out of position into. Avoid playing pep in the ambush style in solo queue because you are more likely to frustrate your teammates not understanding what you're trying to do instead of successfully organizing a favorable teamfight.</p>

                <p>5 seconds of reapplying blinds is brutal in teamfights featuring other melee characters, and it's usually enough to keep you fairly safe after diving into ranged auto-attackers like FP or BMO.</p>

                <p>Deceptively long range dash + stun, but it is very telegraphed so only use it if you're sure you will hit your target or escape after using it, otherwise you'll leave yourself extremely easy to hit with any skillshots or targeted aoes.</p>

                <p>Peppemint Butler becomes the strongest character in the game for 7 seconds, but he also becomes silenced so you can only really use this ability in teamfights with other setup, otherwise you are better off using it for finshing off people running away, or escaping yourself. Also extremely good for shredding boss camps.</p>

            <h2 class="advancedtips"><a id="advancedtipslink">Advanced Tips</a></h2>
            <p>Peppermint Butler is one of the hardest characters in ATBP to play well as both of his gameplay styles require in-depth knowledge of rotations and other parts of the meta. To offset this his kit is one of the simplest to understand mechanically.</p>
            <p>The highest traffic areas to camp around with your passive, acting as a living ward or to pick any single targets that happen to walk by without their teammates for whatever reason are near the cyclops tears on the far left and right of the jungle. Other high traffic areas would be the enemy's entrance to the goo monster, and just below the middle altar.</p>
            <p>You can also use your passive to play more deceptively, using your W to cross over the middle wall into your opponents base, taking both of their cyclops tears, and clearing the minion wave of whatever lane you want to put pressure on as they spawn. Afterwards just use your passive to hide in a sneaky spot until your W is off cooldown and you can leave again, only to come back and do it once more every 1:30 minutes or so. The enemy team will have no choice but to waste a massive amount of time (and most likely at least two players, as pep is very threatening in a 1v1) to come stop you while your teammates gain benefits elsewhere. </p>

            <h2>Meta and Role</h2>
            <p>Peppermint Butler fits well into teams as a secondary intiator(alongside a Jake, Magic Man, etc) or dedicated jungler. He also works as described in the previous section, forcing attention away from his teammates by proxying waves and stealing resources in the enemy's base instead of fighting them head on. Unfortunately due to pepbuts reliance on his teammates to do do well in even matches, he tends to not be a great choice for solo queue. Like other unpopular characters though, him not being a great choice in a vacuum may work to your advantage due to the enemy team having a higher chance of not having enough knowledge of the character to properly deal with his weirder play style. Pep can also be used in a team as a tank to protect his squishier backline against their main threats of dives like Magic Man or Finn, his Q and W are usually enough to get them to back off temporarily while your backline does the damage for you.</p>

            <div class="builds">
            <ul>
            <li>Techno Tank - 1/1/3/3/1/3/1/3/5/5 (4/0/4/0/2) OR Bella Noche's Knapsack - 1/1/3/3/1/3/1/3/5/5 : Basically the de facto build for most of the cast, both of these work very well for the initiation based and tankier based styles for pepbut, while also offering decent goo monster clear speeds</li>
            <li>Billy's Bag - 1/1/5/5/1/5/1/5/3/3 (4/0/2/0/4) : Peps full dive build, you can do a huge amount of damage with your ult up but be aware that you are extremely easy to kill for anyone who doesnt focus exclusively on auto attacks. This build can also be used for the resource stealing play style by switching the build order of Loincloth and Enchiridion, allowing you to move around the map annoyingly fast while also being able to take more of a beating.</li>
            <li>Bindle of Bravery - 1/1/3/3/1/3/1/3/5/5 (4/0/4/0/2) : Probably Pepbuts most well-rounded option, You can use this very similarly to the resource stealing Billy's Bag build but in addition even if you are behind you will steal probably be the best at taking camps on your team, allowing you to potentially even steal the opponents 1camp during your rotations in and out of their base. This build also works fine as a replacement to the bruiser build, but is obviously less effective than the full tank build for that role.   </li>
